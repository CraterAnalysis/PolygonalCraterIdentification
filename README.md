# PolygonalCraterIdentification
Python code that identifies whether a crater rim trace is polygonal, how many edges, their directions, etc.

The initial commit of this code is now uploaded along with a sample .CSV file as a test crater.  All command-line arguments are optional, but the "body radius" is important and results will change based on its value.  Remaining values are experimental and will likely change based on further work, or you can enter your own.
